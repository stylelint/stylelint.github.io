Not only will you help stylelint thrive, you will also learn a thing or two — about CSS, PostCSS, Node, ES2015, unit testing, open source software, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>We want to do everything we can to encourage contributions!</strong> So if you want to participate but don't end up doing it for one reason or another, please file an issue and give us feedback about what we could do to better encourage you.</p>\n<p>Also: we hope that your participation in the project isn't a one-off. <em>We'd love to add more members to the organization and see more regulars pop up in issues and pull requests!</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"code-contributions\"><a href=\"#code-contributions\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Code contributions</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"../developer-guide/\">developer guide</a> outlines how to get started contributing code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"financial-contributions\"><a href=\"#financial-contributions\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Financial contributions</h2>\n<p>We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/stylelint\">open collective</a>.\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.</p>\n","__filename":"contributing.md","__url":"/contributing/","__resourceUrl":"/contributing/index.html","__dataUrl":"/contributing/index.html.09ae98501a7aea55657474909879771b.json"}
