We also discuss whether the rule meets the following criteria for inclusion in stylelint:\n\n- Applicable to standard CSS syntax only.\n- Useful to the majority of users.\n- Has a clear and unambiguous finished state.\n\nOtherwise, it should be a plugin.\n\nOnce you have something to show, you'll create a [pull request](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/compare) to continue the conversation.\n\n### Come up with a name\n\nHave a look at the [rules user guide](/user-guide/about-rules/) to familiarize yourself the rule naming conventions.\n\nWe take care to ensure that all the rules are named accurately and consistently. Our goals in that effort are to ensure that rules are easy to find and understand, and to prevent us from wanting to change the name later.\n\n### Determine options\n\n#### Primary\n\nEvery rule *must have* a **primary option**.\n\n- In `\"color-hex-case\": \"upper\"`, the primary option is `\"upper\"`.\n- In `\"indentation\": [2, { \"except\": [\"block\"] }]`, the primary option is `2`.\n\n#### Secondary\n\nSome rules require extra flexibility to address a variety of use-cases. These can use a **secondary options object**.\n\n- In `\"color-hex-case\": \"upper\"`, there is no secondary options object.\n- In `\"indentation\": [2, { \"except\": [\"block\"] }]`, the secondary options object is `{ \"except\": [\"block\"] }`.\n\nThe most typical secondary options are `\"ignore\": []` and `\"except\": []`; but anything is possible.\n\n`\"ignore\"` and `\"except\"` accept an array of predefined keyword options e.g. `[\"relative\", \"first-nested\", \"descendant\"]`. Use `\"ignore\"` when you want the rule to simply skip-over a particular pattern, and use `\"except\"` when you want to invert the primary option for a particular pattern.\n\nUse a more specific secondary option name when accepting a *user-defined* list of things to ignore. For example, use `\"ignoreAtRules\": []` if a rule checks at-rules and you want to allow a user to specify which particular at-rule types to ignore.\n\nA rule's secondary option can be anything if you're not ignoring or making exceptions. As an example, `resolveNestedSelectors: true|false` is used within some `selector-*` rules to change how the rule processes nested selectors.\n\n#### Be explicit\n\n*Use explicit, rather than implicit, options.* For example, `color-hex-case: \"upper\"|\"lower\"` rather than `color-hex-uppercase: \"always\"|\"never\"`. As `color-hex-uppercase: \"never\"` *implies* always lowercase, whereas `color-hex-case: \"lower\"` makes it *explicit*.\n\n### Determine warning messages\n\nMessages usually take one of these forms:\n\n- \"Expected \\[something\\] \\[in some context\\]\".\n- \"Unexpected \\[something\\] \\[in some context\\].\"\n\nLook at the messages of other rules to glean more conventions and patterns.\n\n### Write the rule\n\n*When writing the rule, always look to other similar rules for conventions and patterns to start from and mimic.*\n\nYou will use the simple [PostCSS API](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/api/) to navigate and analyze the CSS syntax tree. We recommend using the `walk` iterators (e.g. `walkDecls`), rather than using `forEach` to loop through the nodes.\n\nDepending on the rule, we also recommend using [postcss-value-parser](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-value-parser) and [postcss-selector-parser](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-selector-parser).

Please look through those so that you know what's available.

(Looking at other rules for examples of options validation will help a lot.)\n\n### Write tests\n\nEach rule must be accompanied by tests that contain:\n\n- All patterns that are considered warnings.\n- All patterns that should *not* be considered warnings.\n\nIt is easy to write stylelint tests, so *write as many as you can stand to*.\n\n#### Checklist\n\nPlease run through this checklist and ensure each point is covered by your tests. Especially *consider the edge-cases*. These are where the bugs and shortcomings of rules always arise.\n\n##### Best practices\n\n- Ensure you are testing errors in multiple positions, not the same place every time.\n- Ensure you use realistic (if simple) CSS, and avoid the use of ellipses.\n- Ensure you use standard CSS syntax by default, and only swap parsers when testing a specific piece of non-standard syntax.\n\n##### Commonly overlooked edge-cases\n\n- How does your rule handle variables (`$sass`, `@less`, or `var(--custom-property)`)?\n- How does your rule handle CSS strings (e.g. `content: \"anything goes\";`)?\n- How does your rule handle CSS comments (e.g. `/* anything goes */`)?\n- How does your rule handle `url()` functions, including data URIs (e.g. `url(anything/goes.jpg)`)?\n- How does your rule handle vendor prefixes (e.g. `@-webkit-keyframes name {}`)?\n- How does your rule handle case sensitivity (e.g. `@KEYFRAMES name {}`)?\n- How does your rule handle a pseudo-class *combined* with a pseudo-element (e.g. `a:hover::before`)?\n- How does your rule handle nesting (e.g. do you resolve `& a {}`, or check it as is?)?\n- How does your rule handle whitespace and punctuation (e.g. comparing `rgb(0,0,0)` with `rgb(0, 0, 0)`)?\n\n#### Running tests\n\nYou can run the tests via:\n\n```console\nnpm test\n```\n\nHowever, this runs all 10,000+ unit tests and also linting.\n\nTo run tests in a single file only (which you'll want to do during development), you'll need to use `babel-tape-runner` (because the codebase is ES6). For example, to run the test for the `color-hex-case` rule:\n\n```console\n./node_modules/.bin/babel-tape-runner src/rules/color-hex-case/__tests__/index.js\n```\n\n### Write the README\n\nEach rule must be accompanied by a README, fitting the following format:\n\n1. Rule name.\n2. Single line description.\n3. Prototypical code example.\n4. Expanded description (if necessary).\n5. Options.\n6. Example patterns that are considered warnings (for each option value).\n7. Example patterns that are *not* considered warnings (for each option value).\n8. Optional options (if applicable).\n\nLook at the READMEs of other rules to glean more conventional patterns.\n\n#### Single line descriptions\n\nTake the form of:\n\n- \"Disallow ...\" (for `no` rules).\n- \"Limit ...\" (for `max` rules).\n- \"Require ...\" (for rules that accept `\"always\"` and `\"never\"` options).\n- \"Specify ...\" (for everything else).\n\n#### Example patterns\n\n- Use complete CSS patterns i.e. avoid ellipses (`...`)\n- Use standard CSS syntax (and use `css` code fences) by default.\n\n### Wire up the rule\n\nThe final step is to add references to the new rule in the following places:\n\n- [The rules `index.js` file](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/src/rules/index.js)\n- [The CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG/)\n- [The list of rules](/user-guide/rules/)\n- [The example config](/user-guide/example-config/)\n\n## Adding options to existing rules\n\nFirst, open an issue about the option you wish to add. We'll discuss its functionality and name there.\n\nOnce we've agreed on the direction, you can work on a pull request. Here are the steps you'll need to take:\n\n1. Change the rule's validation to allow for the new option.\n2. Add to the rule some logic (as little as possible) to make the option work.\n3. Add new unit tests to test the option.\n4. Add documentation about the new option.\n5. Add a note to the CHANGELOG about your addition.\n\n## Fixing bugs\n\nFixing bugs is usually very easy. Here is a process that works:\n\n1. Write failing unit tests that exemplify the bug.\n2. Fiddle with the rule until those new tests pass.\n3. Add a note to the CHANGELOG about your fix.\n\nThat's it! **If you are unable to figure out how to fix the bug yourself, it is still *extremely* helpful to submit a pull request with your failing test cases.** It means that somebody else can jump right in and help out with the rule's logic.\n","raw":"---\ntitle: Working on rules\n---\n\n# Working on rules\n\n**Please help us create, enhance, and debug stylelint rules!**\n\nThere are well over a hundred rules already, so stylelint *needs* community contributions to continue to improve.\n\nIf you like stylelint and open source software (since you're reading this, you almost certainly do), please consider taking some time to pitch in.

(Looking at other rules for examples of options validation will help a lot.)\n\n### Write tests\n\nEach rule must be accompanied by tests that contain:\n\n- All patterns that are considered warnings.\n- All patterns that should *not* be considered warnings.\n\nIt is easy to write stylelint tests, so *write as many as you can stand to*.\n\n#### Checklist\n\nPlease run through this checklist and ensure each point is covered by your tests. Especially *consider the edge-cases*. These are where the bugs and shortcomings of rules always arise.\n\n##### Best practices\n\n- Ensure you are testing errors in multiple positions, not the same place every time.\n- Ensure you use realistic (if simple) CSS, and avoid the use of ellipses.\n- Ensure you use standard CSS syntax by default, and only swap parsers when testing a specific piece of non-standard syntax.\n\n##### Commonly overlooked edge-cases\n\n- How does your rule handle variables (`$sass`, `@less`, or `var(--custom-property)`)?\n- How does your rule handle CSS strings (e.g. `content: \"anything goes\";`)?\n- How does your rule handle CSS comments (e.g. `/* anything goes */`)?\n- How does your rule handle `url()` functions, including data URIs (e.g. `url(anything/goes.jpg)`)?\n- How does your rule handle vendor prefixes (e.g. `@-webkit-keyframes name {}`)?\n- How does your rule handle case sensitivity (e.g. `@KEYFRAMES name {}`)?\n- How does your rule handle a pseudo-class *combined* with a pseudo-element (e.g. `a:hover::before`)?\n- How does your rule handle nesting (e.g. do you resolve `& a {}`, or check it as is?)?\n- How does your rule handle whitespace and punctuation (e.g. comparing `rgb(0,0,0)` with `rgb(0, 0, 0)`)?\n\n#### Running tests\n\nYou can run the tests via:\n\n```console\nnpm test\n```\n\nHowever, this runs all 10,000+ unit tests and also linting.\n\nTo run tests in a single file only (which you'll want to do during development), you'll need to use `babel-tape-runner` (because the codebase is ES6). For example, to run the test for the `color-hex-case` rule:\n\n```console\n./node_modules/.bin/babel-tape-runner src/rules/color-hex-case/__tests__/index.js\n```\n\n### Write the README\n\nEach rule must be accompanied by a README, fitting the following format:\n\n1. Rule name.\n2. Single line description.\n3. Prototypical code example.\n4. Expanded description (if necessary).\n5. Options.\n6. Example patterns that are considered warnings (for each option value).\n7. Example patterns that are *not* considered warnings (for each option value).\n8. Optional options (if applicable).\n\nLook at the READMEs of other rules to glean more conventional patterns.\n\n#### Single line descriptions\n\nTake the form of:\n\n- \"Disallow ...\" (for `no` rules).\n- \"Limit ...\" (for `max` rules).\n- \"Require ...\" (for rules that accept `\"always\"` and `\"never\"` options).\n- \"Specify ...\" (for everything else).\n\n#### Example patterns\n\n- Use complete CSS patterns i.e. avoid ellipses (`...`)\n- Use standard CSS syntax (and use `css` code fences) by default.\n\n### Wire up the rule\n\nThe final step is to add references to the new rule in the following places:\n\n- [The rules `index.js` file](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/src/rules/index.js)\n- [The CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG/)\n- [The list of rules](/user-guide/rules/)\n- [The example config](/user-guide/example-config/)\n\n## Adding options to existing rules\n\nFirst, open an issue about the option you wish to add. We'll discuss its functionality and name there.\n\nOnce we've agreed on the direction, you can work on a pull request. Here are the steps you'll need to take:\n\n1. Change the rule's validation to allow for the new option.\n2. Add to the rule some logic (as little as possible) to make the option work.\n3. Add new unit tests to test the option.\n4. Add documentation about the new option.\n5. Add a note to the CHANGELOG about your addition.\n\n## Fixing bugs\n\nFixing bugs is usually very easy. Here is a process that works:\n\n1. Write failing unit tests that exemplify the bug.\n2. Fiddle with the rule until those new tests pass.\n3. Add a note to the CHANGELOG about your fix.\n\nThat's it! **If you are unable to figure out how to fix the bug yourself, it is still *extremely* helpful to submit a pull request with your failing test cases.** It means that somebody else can jump right in and help out with the rule's logic.\n","__filename":"developer-guide/rules.md","__url":"/developer-guide/rules/","__resourceUrl":"/developer-guide/rules/index.html","__dataUrl":"/developer-guide/rules/index.html.1719c4b52f6f19c14b1bccc5bda53b5a.json"}
