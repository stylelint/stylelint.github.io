For example:\n\n* `color-hex-case: \"upper\"|\"lower\"` rather than `color-hex-uppercase: \"always\"|\"never\"`\n\nAs `color-hex-uppercase: \"never\"` *implies* always lowercase.\n\n## Messages\n\nTake the form of:\n\n* \"Expected a ... something\"\n* \"Unexpected ... something\" (for rejection e.g. when something is disallowed)\n\n## README\n\nEach rule must be accompanied by a README, which takes the form of:\n\n1. Rule name.\n2. Single line description.\n3. Code example (if necessary).\n4. Expanded description (if necessary).\n5. Options (if applicable).\n6.
